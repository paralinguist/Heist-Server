Oh hey *, how's <family>'s band practice going?
*, I was sorry to hear about <family> getting sick. Are they feeling better?
I bet <family> enjoyed their trip away the other day, hey *?
Hi *, you must be very proud of <family> with their last test results!
What's up *? I was just thinking about the last time we spoke about <family>. Have they almost graduated now?
I'm so glad I ran into you, *! I heard that <family> was an expert on network diagrams - maybe they can give me a hand sometime?
