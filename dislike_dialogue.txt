Oh hi there *. Care to share your thoughts on <dislike>? Personally, I'm bothered by them.
I feel so angry about <dislike> I can hardly focus on work. What do you think, *?
Oh man, turns out tomorrow, there are going to be more <dislike>. *, I bet that makes you furious too!
Can you believe the company is increasing the amount of <dislike>, *? What a mistake!
I heard you speaking about how you're fed up with all the <dislike>. Me, too - I thought, "I bet * has more to say about that!"
